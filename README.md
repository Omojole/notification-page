## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles

### What I learnt
- Bootstrap is used to ensure responsiveness of websites not just styling
-HTML structure matters a lot
- how to make an event fire just once
```js
{once:true};
```
-Use of foreach loop in js


### Continued development
-Focusing on expanding my knowledge in js
-learning more bootstrap classes


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com) - This helped me discover a lot of ways to make my notification countdown function on one click,although i did not get my answer here. It's my first stop whenever i have issues
